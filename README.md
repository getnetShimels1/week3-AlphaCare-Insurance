# week3-AlphaCare-Insurance
# Overall Objective
To analyze historical insurance claim data for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) to optimize marketing strategies and identify low-risk clients for reduced premiums.

# Key Areas to Focus On
Insurance Terminologies

Familiarize yourself with the industry language (e.g., premiums, claims, underwriting).
Check the 50 Common Insurance Terms and What They Mean for a quick glossary.
# A/B Hypothesis Testing

    Null hypotheses to test:
    No risk differences across provinces, zip codes, or gender.
    No significant profit margin differences between zip codes.
    Use statistical tests (chi-squared for categorical data, t-tests for numerical).
    Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling
    Develop predictive models for total claims and optimal premiums:
    Regression models (Linear regression, Random Forests, XGBoost).
    Focus on feature sets: car, owner, location, and plan attributes.
    Evaluate model performance and interpret feature importance using tools like SHAP or LIME.

# Deliverables
# GitHub repo with:
    Clean modular code, version control (using Git), and CI/CD setup.
    DVC for data versioning and storage management.
    Reports detailing methods, findings, and actionable recommendations.
# Tasks Breakdown
    # Task 1: EDA & Git/GitHub
        # Git Setup
            Create a GitHub repo and a branch for Task 1 (task-1).
            Commit work with descriptive messages at least 3 times/day.
        # EDA Steps
            Summarize data (e.g., descriptive statistics for numerical features like TotalPremium, TotalClaims).
            Visualize distributions (histograms, boxplots for outliers).
            Analyze relationships between variables (scatter plots, correlation matrices).
            Create creative and informative visualizations to summarize insights.
            Ensure data quality by identifying and handling missing values.
    # Task 2: Data Version Control
        Setup DVC
        Initialize DVC in your repo and set up local remote storage.
        Track datasets and create data versions with dvc add.
        Push .dvc files to GitHub.
        Branch Management
        Merge Task 1 into the main branch and create a new branch (task-2).
        Commit descriptive messages.
    # Task 3: A/B Hypothesis Testing
        Hypotheses Testing
        Select metrics (e.g., risk level, profit margin).
        Segment data into control and test groups for comparison.
        Apply statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared, t-test) to accept/reject null hypotheses.
        Interpret p-values:
        ùëù<0.05
        p<0.05: Reject null hypothesis (significant differences exist).
        ùëù‚â•0.05
        p‚â•0.05: Fail to reject null hypothesis.
        Branch Management
        Merge Task 2 and create task-3.
        Document findings and their implications for business strategy.
    # Task 4: Statistical Modeling
        # Data Prep
        Impute/remove missing values.
        Encode categorical variables.
        Perform a train-test split (e.g., 80-20 split).
        Model Building
        Implement models like Linear Regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
        # Evaluation
        Use metrics like RMSE (regression) or accuracy/F1-score (classification).
        Analyze feature importance to explain influential factors in claims and premium prediction.
